          causes of poor education in children
        </h2>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          Few things have such a diverse and far-reaching consequence on the
          overall quality of a person’s life and that of a community, as lack of
          education. Although it is categorized as one of the fundamental human
          rights, education is nowadays denied to many children around the
          world. According to the Borgen Project research 72 million children do
          not attend primary school, and a staggering number of 759 million
          adults are illiterate.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          The causes that prevent one from getting a quality education are just
          as severe as the effects that the lack of education generates. This is
          why societies with poor economies and insufficiently developed
          education systems are unable to leave the vicious circle without
          outside intervention or help. Simply put, building a good education
          system requires a strong economy, and a strong economy in turn
          requires quality education. Therefore, one of the most important
          global issues is how to provide every individual in the world with
          access to education.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 font-bold">What causes lack of education?</p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          Developed countries have long recognized the importance of education,
          therefore, in many of these countries access to education is a given.
          On the other hand, for many underdeveloped countries and economically
          struggling parts of the world, education is a luxury that is often
          unaffordable to most. The reasons why many individuals around the
          world have been denied access to a quality education and why the
          knowledge they possess is not enough to successfully tackle the
          challenges of the 21st century can be economic, geographical, and
          social in nature.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 font-bold">1) Lack of Schools</p>
        <p>
          School is much more than a building where teaching takes place. School
          also includes teachers, teaching materials, and all those other things
          that make an education system. However, all this requires money. The
          economic position of some countries is such that even with all the
          help they receive, they do not have enough funds to build schools to
          provide the necessary education to their children.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className=" py-2 font-bold">
          2) Not understanding the importance of education
        </p>
        <p>
          The economic situation and a low level of education in some countries
          are the main reasons why children are forced to struggle for survival
          from an early age, leaving no time for education.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 font-bold">3) Lack of money</p>
        <p>
          Another economically-based reason is the fact that many families do
          not have enough money even for the basic needs, which is why children
          in such families have to work from an early age. According to
          research, about 300 million children between the ages of five and
          seventeen work, so child labor is one of the major causes for lack of
          education.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 font-bold">4) Unfavorable geographical position</p>
        <p>
          Some countries lack the needed infrastructure or are located in the
          parts of the world with severe climate which makes commuting to school
          significantly more difficult.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 font-bold">5) Prejudice</p>
        <p>
          Members of ethnic and other minorities, as well as children with
          disabilities are often the target of prejudice in some countries,
          which makes it more difficult for them to get an education in
          comparison to other groups.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 font-bold">6) Inadequate conditions</p>
        <p>
          According to UNICEF, the lack of qualified teachers, inadequate
          teaching materials, and poor sanitation are some of the reasons why
          many children do not receive a quality education. Even when they do go
          to school, children in such conditions fail to acquire applicable and
          quality knowledge, sometimes even basic knowledge. UNICEF states that
          617 million children and adolescents around the world fail to acquire
          even the minimum literacy and math knowledge, although two thirds of
          them attend school.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          It should also be noted that the lack of education does not only arise
          from not having access to education and non-attendance, but it is also
          a direct consequence of poor quality of teaching. Thus, UNICEF
          underlines that “Schooling does not always lead to learning.
          Worldwide, there are more non-learners in school than out of school”.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          In other words, in addition to the general approach to education, it
          is also necessary to raise the quality of instruction so as to
          overcome the global issue that the lack of education represents.{" "}
