          The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that education is a
          fundamental human right for everyone and this right was further
          detailed in the Convention against Discrimination in Education. What
          exactly does that mean?
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 font-bold">
          Why is education a fundamental human right?
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          * Quality education aims to ensure the development of a fully-rounded
          human being.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          * It is one of the most powerful tools in lifting socially excluded
          children and adults out of poverty and into society. UNESCO data shows
          that if all adults completed secondary education, globally the number
          of poor people could be reduced by more than half.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          * It narrows the gender gap for girls and women. A UN study showed
          that each year of schooling reduces the probability of infant
          mortality by 5 to 10 per cent.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          * For this human right to work there must be equality of opportunity,
          universal access, and enforceable and monitored quality standards.

          * About 258 million children and youth are out of school, according to
          UIS data for the school year ending in 2018. The total includes 59

        <p className="py-4 font-bold">How is the right to education ensured?</p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          The right to education is established by two means - normative
          international instruments and political commitments by governments. A
          solid international framework of conventions and treaties exist to
          protect the right to education and States that sign up to them agree
          to respect, protect and fulfil this right.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 font-bold">
          How does R.A.G.E work to ensure the right to education?
        </p>
        <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
          R.A.G.E develops, monitors and promotes education norms and standards
          to guarantee the right to education at country level and advance the
          aims of the Education 2030 Agenda. It works to ensure States' legal
          obligations are reflected in national legal frameworks and translated
          into concrete policies.
